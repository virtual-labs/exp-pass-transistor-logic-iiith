      "question": "1. Multiplexer is a ?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Combinational Circuit",
        "b": "Both a and c",
        "c": " Sequential Circuit",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of many inputs based on control signals.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Both a and c cannot be correct; only combinational is correct.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Multiplexers do not store information or have memory elements, so they are not sequential circuits.",
        "d": "Incorrect. None of the above is not correct; multiplexer is a combinational circuit."

      "question": "2. Transmission gate is a?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Parallel combination of two NMOS",
        "b": "Series combination of NMOS and PMOS",
        "c": "Parallel combination of NMOS and PMOS",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A transmission gate is not a parallel combination of two NMOS transistors; it uses both NMOS and PMOS in parallel.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A transmission gate is not a series combination of NMOS and PMOS transistors.",
        "c": "Correct. A transmission gate is a parallel combination of NMOS and PMOS, allowing bidirectional current flow.",
        "d": "Incorrect. One of the above options is correct, not none."

      "question": "3. Transmission gate is preferred over Complementary CMOS logic because ____",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Transistor count required to implement a logic function in transmission gate is low",
        "b": "Low Delay",
        "c": "Both of them",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Low transistor count alone is not the only reason transmission gates are preferred; low delay is also important.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Low delay alone is not the only reason transmission gates are preferred; low transistor count is also important.",
        "c": "Correct. Transmission gates are preferred over complementary CMOS logic because they have lower transistor count and low delay.",
        "d": "Incorrect. One of the above options is correct, not none."

      "question": "4. How many 2x1 multiplexer will be require to design 8x1 multiplexer?",

        "a": "Three",
        "b": "Seven",
        "c": "Four",
        "d": "Eight"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Three 2x1 multiplexers are not sufficient to design an 8x1 multiplexer.",
        "b": "Correct. Seven 2x1 multiplexers are required to design an 8x1 multiplexer using cascading.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Four 2x1 multiplexers are not sufficient for an 8x1 multiplexer.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Eight 2x1 multiplexers are not required; fewer can achieve the same functionality."

        "b": "Data Select",
        "c": "Single Input Many Output",
        "d": "None"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A counter is not a multiplexer; it counts pulses, not selects data.",
        "b": "Correct. A multiplexer is also known as a data select because it selects one of many inputs.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Multiplexer is not a single input many output device; it is the opposite.",
        "d": "Incorrect. None is not correct; multiplexer is a well-defined digital circuit."
